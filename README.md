# Data Analytics SQL Assessment

This repository contains my SQL solutions for a four-part data analytics assessment. The tasks focus on customer behavior insights, transaction activity analysis, account monitoring, and lifetime value estimation ‚Äî all done using MySQL.

## ‚úÖ Question-by-Question Breakdown

### üîπ Question 1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

**Objective:**  
Identify customers who have both a savings plan and an investment plan, and rank them by total deposits.

**Approach:**  
- Used `plans_plan` to find customers with at least one savings plan (`is_regular_savings = 1`) and one investment plan (`is_a_fund = 1`).
- Joined with `savings_savingsaccount` to compute total confirmed deposits, converting from kobo to naira.
- Customer names were constructed using `first_name + last_name` with `COALESCE` to handle nulls or blanks.
- Results sorted by total deposits in descending order.

### üîπ Question 2: Transaction Frequency Analysis

**Objective:**  
Categorize customers based on how often they transact each month.

**Approach:**  
- Counted the number of transactions per customer from `savings_savingsaccount`.
- Calculated active months using the difference between the current date and the customer's first transaction using `PERIOD_DIFF`.
- Divided total transactions by active months to get an average.
- Categorized customers into:
  - High Frequency: ‚â•10/month
  - Medium Frequency: 3‚Äì9/month
  - Low Frequency: ‚â§2/month
- Aggregated the count of customers in each category and calculated their average monthly frequency.

### üîπ Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert

**Objective:**  
Find savings or investment plans with no deposit transactions in the last 365 days.

**Approach:**  
- Identified active plans using `plans_plan` (`is_regular_savings = 1` or `is_a_fund = 1`).
- Retrieved the most recent transaction date per plan from `savings_savingsaccount`.
- Calculated inactivity days using `DATEDIFF`.
- Filtered to include only accounts where the last transaction was more than 365 days ago.
- Output included plan ID, owner ID, plan type, last transaction date, and inactivity duration.

### üîπ Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

**Objective:**  
Estimate each customer's lifetime value based on tenure and transaction volume.

**Approach:**  
- Assumed profit per transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value.
- Calculated:
  - Tenure: months since `date_joined` using `PERIOD_DIFF`
  - Total profit = 0.001 √ó confirmed amount (in kobo ‚Üí naira)
  - CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) √ó 12 √ó avg profit per transaction
- Used customer ID and constructed full name from `first_name + last_name`.

**Note on Duplicate Names:**  
If the same full name appears multiple times in the output, it is because different customers (with different IDs) may share the same name ‚Äî this is normal and expected. We identify customers by their unique `id`, not name, because names are not guaranteed to be unique in any real-world dataset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Encountered

| Challenge                           | Solution                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing or null customer names     | Replaced by combining `first_name + last_name`, and defaulted to `'Unknown'` |
| Inconsistent date logic            | Used MySQL's `PERIOD_DIFF` and `DATEDIFF` for time-based calculations   |
| Amounts in kobo (not naira)        | Converted all money values by dividing by 100                            |
| Repeated names in CLV results      | Correctly handled by grouping by `id` and explaining that names can repeat |

## üîç Data Observations

During exploration, I noticed that some customers appeared to have **multiple accounts** in the `users_customuser` table:
- Same full name and **same phone number**
- Different customer IDs
- Different email addresses

This indicates that either:
- The same person registered more than once (possibly for different products)
- Or the system does not enforce uniqueness on phone numbers

In all queries, I followed the business rule of treating each `id` as a unique customer. However, this kind of duplication is common in real-world data and would be addressed in identity resolution models outside the scope of this assessment.

## üß† Assumptions

- Each row in `savings_savingsaccount` is a separate deposit transaction.
- `confirmed_amount` is stored in **kobo**, not naira.
- `plans_plan` defines a savings plan when `is_regular_savings = 1`, and an investment plan when `is_a_fund = 1`.
- Only deposits were considered; withdrawals were not used in these analyses.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **SQL Engine:** MySQL 8.0
- **IDE:** MySQL Workbench
- **Functions Used:** `PERIOD_DIFF`, `DATEDIFF`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, `TRIM`, `CONCAT`, `ROUND`

## üìåNotes

All queries are optimized for clarity and correctness, with meaningful comments and formatting. Business logic was interpreted carefully based on the provided schema and expected outputs.
